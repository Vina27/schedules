# Write a Person class.

# When creating a new person, we should provide only an argument of a name.

# The person should be instantiated with these attributes: hunger_time, last_hunger_change, name, satiation. Only name will remain unchanged in this example.

# Add a class variable of "bubbles" (@@bubbles). The variable should hold a value of a string: "bubbles everywhere".

# Add an instance behavior called "shower". Its body can be empty, return whatever you want or just puts something.
