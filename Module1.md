## Mod1 Expectations
Welcome to Module 1, where we will expand and deepen your understanding of Ruby. In the next three weeks, you should become more comfortable with writing Ruby in Object Oriented paradigm, combine it with a database and finally, create your own CLI. Please don't panic -- we will guide you through this process. 

In order to take most of this mod, please take these pieces of advice to heart:
- do your labs and make sure to at least skim the priority ones before the lecture;
- if anything is unclear, recognize it early and act on it: verbalize a question, google it, ask a peer or on [the questions channel](https://flatiron-school.slack.com/archives/C018TV7P7UG), ask a coach (in this order);
- check yourself for understanding -- you will find tasks/questions in the schedule section that help you self-check.

One thing to remember is that **Ruby was designed to make your life easier**. Now, because you don't have much experience with other programming languages, it may be difficult at times to trust that this is the best it gets but please take the best practices I share in the lecture to heart. It will all make sense. 

Lastly, a point that often frustrates students is that we first learn how something works under the hood (or, do it the long way), then learn that Ruby has a handy-dandy tool/abstracted method to do it all in just one line, and only then we learn that there's even more ‚ú® magic ‚ú® to use. "Why couldn't we just learn the magic?", we often hear. Well, think about it this way: 
- üéÇ you may just go to the bakery and buy **a ready-made Red Velvet cake**. Sure, everyone will be happy. However, does this make you a good pastry chef? No. 
- ü•£ Okay, so you can go to a store and buy **a cake mix** and you bake it at home. You can customize it a bit and while that doesn't make you a chef, you certainly know at least how the oven works. 
- ü•ö However, the true chef would **make a Red Velvet cake from scratch**: using eggs, flour (gluten-free or wholewheat) and other ingredients, control sugar measurements and the ultimate shape and height of the cake.

Same with Ruby and software development: you could just skip a few steps and get right to the magic but if you ever wanted to customize the magic, you need to know how it's working. 

In order to not leave you feeling tricked, I will gradually fill out this table marking how topics relate to each other so you see how what you learn actually has a purpose:

<table>
<tr>
    <td style="text-align:center" width="150px"> ü•ö </td>
    <td style="text-align:center" width="150px"> ü•£ </td>
    <td style="text-align:center" width="150px"> üéÇ </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td style="text-align:center" width="150px"> <code>def name=(name)</code> </td>
    <td style="text-align:center" width="150px"> ? </td>
    <td style="text-align:center" width="150px"> ? </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td style="text-align:center" width="150px"> <code>def name</code> </td>
    <td style="text-align:center" width="150px"> ? </td>
    <td style="text-align:center" width="150px"> ? </td>
</tr>
</table>

## Week 1 Schedule

Week one of every module is designated for you to get exposure to different topics that you will consolidate over the following weekend and the days before the code challenge and then practice further in the project week. Usually, you will get **A LOT** of labs in the first days -- please know you will have time to finish them by the end of the week and focus initially on the priority ones. In Mod1 Week1 you will:
- write your own classes,
- use getter and setter methods for attributes,
- add instance and class methods,
- be able to check what `self` denotes,
- connect two (or more!) classes together,
- draw domain models,
- use `map`, `find`, `select` and `each` on instances of classes.

These are the skills you need to prioritize when studying this week. Please take every opportunity to write code. If you're lacking prompts from labs, just look around yourself and write a code description of your room (your room being one class, with other classes being furniture, people, plants, etc. -- add aspecific behaviors and interdependencies, etc.).
