# Mod 2 Individual Roadmap

## Description
Welcome to Mod2! Your Mod2 experience will be split into nine milestones that together make up a project. You will be working closely with coaches, labs and lectures. Please don't hesitate to reach out to your peers and to the coaches if you feel stuck. You may spend as little or as much time as you need on a milestone but ideally, you will:
- cover milestones number 1-3 in the first week,
- cover milestones number 4-6 in the second week,
- cover milestones number 7-9 in the third week.

The deliverables are thought to be just guiding points for you and also for the coaches to check in with you about your work. After you finish a deliverable (or before a check in), remember to commit your code and push to github.
